# Tic-Tack-Toe-Game
It is a Tic Tack Toe game made with the Swing and JUnit Testing frameworks following the MVC design pattern

## Objecitives:
* Create the game using JAVA and using Event listeners to listen to Button clickes.
* Use a 3x3 Grid Layout made up of JButtons for the tic-tac-toe board.
* When a button is selected, the players "mark" (either "X" or "O", depending on whose turn it is) appears in the button and the button can no longer be selected.
* After the game ends, no buttons may be selected
* Add a label field (e.g. at the bottom of your frame) to indicate the current state of the game (e.g. game in progress and X's turn; game in progress and O's turn; game over tie; game over X wins; game over O wins) in a label field.
* The label must change so that it is always current (i.e. reflects the current state of the game).
